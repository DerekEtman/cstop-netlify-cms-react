section1: |-
  The COVID compliance team (CCT) is not production, nor is it craft
  services, or locations. The COVID compliance officer (CCO) or team member
  is not one person with a certificate. The CCO or CCT should not be
  medical personnel or set medics without a production background either.
  In our experience, the most successful teams have been a collaboration of
  veteran union set-medics, coupled with experienced Producers/Production
  Managers with multiple COVID compliance courses/completion certificates
  between them.

section2: |-
  Thoroughly trained in infection prevention and control through the
  World Health Organization course for COVID-19 Virus + C19CO + OSHA
  30 and more. Keeping our sets safe takes pre-planning,
  collaborating, organizational skills, insightful conversations,
  compassion, strength, knowledge, presentation materials and more. We
  need to anticipate, be proactive, and solution oriented.
