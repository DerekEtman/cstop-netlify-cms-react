subtitle: "##### Safety Culture"
paragraph: Our mission is to ensure the health and safety of our clients and
  their staff, above and below the line crew and talent as well as the integrity
  of our jobs, shoots and partnerships. We have created and are implementing an
  approach to production that is recognized by the CDC, LA County Health, IATSE,
  SAG and other industry leaders and worldwide organizations. Our methods and
  protocols have proven to be successful. We adhere to all federal, state and
  local guidelines which include, but are not limited to safety plans,
  physical distancing, hygiene protocols, Covid-19 testing (lab based PCR and
  antigen) nationwide, staffing & operations and cleaning, sanitizing &
  disinfecting. With our informed leaders and highly trained safety compliance
  teams, we help minimize the risk of bringing an infection home.
