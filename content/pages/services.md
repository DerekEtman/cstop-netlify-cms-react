    section1Body: |- 
        The first two we are very familiar with: coming in on or under
        budget and staying on schedule to make that happen. But now we have
        a duty to protect the health and safety of our crews, talent and
        families like never before. This is a HUGE responsibility not to be
        taken lightly. We must treat this with reverence and respect because
        one careless move could put us all at risk. In order for us to keep
        working in a safe and healthy way, we need to establish a new
        department of team leaders that we know and trust. This team becomes
        the face of the company they represent and therefore must be
        culpable and professional in our collective and vigorous fight
        against infectious diseases especially COVID-19.
