    Our production experience makes us front runners for collaborating,
    developing, implementing

    new procedures, and/or working closely with production to ensure safety requirements are

    clearly explained and properly executed on set. We understand that staying on budget, while

    staying on schedule can be a challenge, especially with the added duty of protecting the health

    and safety of our crews, talent, and families from COVID-19 exposure. We approach this

    responsibility with reverence and respect, knowing one careless move can put us all at risk.


    Our services closely follow the guidance and recommendations published by the CDC, OSHA,

    DGA, SAG•AFTRA, TASK FORCE, AICP, IATSE, Local 80, and more.

    We welcome you to join us in crafting the perfect COVID-19 Compliance Package for your next

    project!
